# Fastamp 
Dartmouth COSC 189 Computational Fabrication Final Project  

We are trying to fabricate a highly personalized stamp with user's 3D reconstructed face model as the stamp handler, and a cartoonified facial expression as the mark.

This repo provides a way to reconstructed user's 3D face model based on captured setup images and a 3D facial expression database[1]. The original idea comes from [2].  

# Run
Just executing `setup.m` will apply the two-step fitting approach
